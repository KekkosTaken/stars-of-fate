# Notes for translators
- A code editor with syntax highlighting (Visual Code Studio, Notepad++, GitHub's own editor, really anything with lua support) is recommended for easier readability.
- Any value in a non-English file can be safely deleted, the game will fall back to the English text if a requested index can't be found.
- Stand name and move name translations aren't super important unless the language uses a different lexicon that can't be read using the English alphabet.
